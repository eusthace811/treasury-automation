# Treasury Automation Challenge

This project is an AI-powered chatbot application for managing treasury operations through natural language. It enables users to create, simulate, and schedule complex payment rules with conversational AI, simulating real-world treasury scenarios using mock financial data.

## üß† Purpose

* **Primary Goal**: Treasury management automation via chat.
* **Core Feature**: "Chat-as-rule-storage" ‚Äî rules are embedded directly in chat records.

## üì¶ Breakdown

### Chat-as-Rule-Storage

* Rules are embedded in the `chats` table as `ruleData` (JSONB)
* No dedicated rule table simplifies context-aware AI interaction

### AI Tooling

Located in `lib/ai/tools/`, each rule goes through:

1. `rule-parser.ts` ‚Äî NL ‚Üí JSON
2. `rule-validator.ts` ‚Äî Zod validation
3. `rule-evaluator.ts` ‚Äî conflict detection
4. `rule-updater.ts` ‚Äî stores & syncs to QStash

### Simulation Engine

* `lib/treasury/simulator.ts`
* Performs dry-run validation based on account balances, beneficiaries, and conditions

### Context Resolution

* `context-resolver.ts` maps dynamic entities like `contractors`, `accounts`, and `invoices`

### Scheduling: QStash

* Rules get scheduled via Upstash QStash (`lib/qstash/`)
* Modes:

  * `schedule` ‚Üí cron-based
  * `once` ‚Üí delayed single exec

### Webhook Execution

* Triggered by QStash ‚Üí `app/api/chat/qstash/`
* Verifies conditions ‚Üí re-runs simulation ‚Üí logs result

### UI Interfaces

* `/chat/[id]`: Main rule creation interface
* `/queue`: Logs + schedules tabbed UI
* `components/queue/*`: All real-time queue management components


## üõ† How to Run

See [README.md](../README.md) and [ONBOARDING.md](./ONBOARDING.md).


## üß© Extending the Project

This project is built to be extensible. You can integrate real payment processors, expand rule types with new logic or condition handlers, and connect additional data sources for richer treasury context. The AI agent can be extended with new tools or enhanced reasoning models, or any improvements in parsing, validation, or execution flow. You can even build multi-tenant support or embed this system into a broader financial automation suite.


## ‚ùì Open Tradeoff

> We store rules inside chat messages instead of a dedicated rules table.

**Pros**:

* Unified UX
* Simpler DB schema
* Easier to evolve with conversation

**Cons**:

* Harder to index
* More brittle schema coupling

We chose this to align with the conversational UX and simplify short-term implementation.

## üîÅ Handoff & Next Steps

See [HANDOFF.md](./HANDOFF.md) for what should be documented if this is handed off to another dev or team.

This codebase is NOT production ready, but we have a with strong architecture, typed validation, modular AI tools, and a possible clear roadmap for full real-world integration.
